            <h3>How is cricket played</h3>
            <p> Cricket is a sport played between two teams of eleven players each, with each team taking turns to bat and bowl. Here are some of the basic rules of cricket:
                <!-- Start of an Desciption List -->
                <dl>
                    <dt>Playing Area:</dt><dd> The playing area is an oval-shaped field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the center. There are boundary lines on the field which determine the area within which the ball must be hit to score runs.</dd>

                    <dt>Teams:</dt><dd> Each team has 11 players. One team bats while the other team bowls and fields.

                    <dt>Innings:</dt><dd> An innings is the period of play during which one team bats and the other team bowls. Each team gets two innings to bat, except in some limited-overs formats of the game.

                    <dt>Batting:</dt><dd> The objective of the batting team is to score runs by hitting the ball with the bat and running between the wickets. If the ball is hit beyond the boundary, it is considered a boundary or a six.

                    <dt>Bowling:</dt><dd> The objective of the bowling team is to get the batsmen out by bowling the ball in a way that makes it difficult for the batsman to hit or defend it. A bowler can take a maximum of 10 wickets in an innings.

                    <dt>Wickets:</dt><dd> The wickets are made up of three stumps and two bails. The bowler aims to hit the wickets with the ball, and if he succeeds in doing so, the batsman is out.

                    <dt>Fielding:</dt><dd> The fielding team tries to prevent the batting team from scoring runs and to take catches or run-outs to get the batsmen out.

                    <dt>Runsa:</dt><dd> Runs are scored when the batsmen run between the wickets after hitting the ball. A run is also scored if the ball is hit beyond the boundary.

                    <dt>Extras:</dt><dd> Extras are additional runs given to the batting team, such as no balls, wide balls, and byes.

                    <dt>Umpires:</dt><dd> The game is controlled by two umpires, who make decisions about whether the ball is out or not out, and whether runs have been scored or not.
                </dl>
                These are some of the basic rules of cricket. There are many other rules and variations to the game, depending on the format of the game being played.
